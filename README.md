All login information in one place. This is the main motto of my login data storage application, Password Manager. Behind its creation were situations when I could not remember the password of my account in some e-shops or social networks. But why didn't I start using similar applications created a long time ago? There are more reasons, but one of the main reasons was the opportunity to learn a lot of new and useful knowledge when writing codes for my own application, but also to have guaranteed security that my login data does not get uncontrollably out of my computer.

### How to install Password Manager

For successful installation, you must download this entire repository. You can do that easily. If you own a computer with Git installed, enter the git clone command via the command line, see down. But if you don't have Git on your computer, you can download the zip folder.

    $ git clone https://github.com/xbuchaj/Password-Manager

Once you have downloaded the repository, open the `Password Manager.exe` file and everything will be ready to create your new account.
    
Python 3.6+ must be installed for the application to function properly. You can find out whether you have it installed or whether you are using the correct one using the command:

    py --version

### How to use Password Manager

In the application, the cursor is moved using the arrows on the keyboard or the enter key. After opening the application, the application will prompt you to enter your login information. If you have not yet created your account in the application, select the `I want to create new account!` option. After creating your account, the application will ask you again to enter your login information. If you enter them correctly, the main application menu will open. New records are created after pressing the N key.

The number of records a user can create is unlimited.
